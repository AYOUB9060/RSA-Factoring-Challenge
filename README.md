# RSA-Factoring-Challenge

Welcome to the RSA-Factoring-Challenge repository!

## About
The RSA-Factoring-Challenge repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing algorithms for factoring large composite numbers using the RSA encryption scheme. Inspired by the historic RSA Factoring Challenge initiated by RSA Laboratories, this project aims to promote research in computational number theory and the practical difficulty of factoring large integers.

## Goal
The primary goal of this repository is to develop an efficient program to factorize large numbers into a product of two smaller numbers. The challenge is to find the two prime factors of each RSA number given only the value of the number itself.

## Contents
The repository contains the following:

### `factors` file
The `factors` file is a file containing natural numbers to factorize. Each line of the file represents an RSA number for which the two prime factors need to be found. The goal is to write a program that can factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers within a time limit of 5 seconds.

### Source Code and Scripts
Contributors are encouraged to submit their executable program or script that can factorize the numbers in the `factors` file. The program should not have any external dependencies and should be able to run independently on the target machine. Please push all your scripts, source code, and executables to the repository.
